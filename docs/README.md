# 🍕 Pizza Delivery API

A RESTful API for managing a pizza delivery system, built with **Python** and **FastAPI**.

This project was developed as part of a learning journey based on a course by **Hashtag Programação**, focused on understanding how APIs work in practice — routing, schemas, authentication, and overall backend structure. From the initial base, the project was expanded and refined to consolidate real-world backend concepts.
